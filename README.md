# sorting-algo-visualizer
Runs through various sorts to help students visualize how they work.

## Purpose

This project's main aim is to implement and animate the basic sorting algorithms to help people understand how they work.

NB. This project has a sub-focus of being a small tuneup for myself in some more involved vanilla js.
